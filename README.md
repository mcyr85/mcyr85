- 👋 Hi, I’m Matt.
- 👀 I’m a full stack developer.  I work with Python, Django, Postgresql, and Vue.
- 🌱 I started my journey as a developer 9 years ago just playing around with it for fun and teaching myself. Seven years later after dabbling here and there and gaining a variety of experience working for a couple companies on projects as an employee and freelancer I decided to do what I love working for myself.
- 💞️ I started my own company and looking to find projects that can provide me the ability to use my current knowledge and continue to learn new things.
- 📫 You can reach me at matt@tapandspigot.com
